# How to use the mock_gbdx_session and vcr to create unit tests:
# 1. Add a new test that is dependent upon actually hitting GBDX APIs.
# 2. Decorate the test with @vcr appropriately
# 3. replace "dummytoken" with a real gbdx token
# 4. Run the tests (existing test shouldn't be affected by use of a real token).  This will record a "cassette".
# 5. replace the real gbdx token with "dummytoken" again
# 6. Edit the cassette to remove any possibly sensitive information (s3 creds for example)
mock_gbdx_session = get_mock_gbdx_session(token="dummytoken")
